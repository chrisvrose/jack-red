**indev** - still being made

Telegram bot deployed using Heroku.

## Why

A test on async await, and typescript. Since this project is IO-bound(mostly), it makes sense to use Node and Typescript.

Special thanks to: [`twss`](https://github.com/DanielRapp/twss.js)

## Usage

*You don't*

But seriously, this is only for me to keep track of stuff

```sh
npm i
npm i --only=dev
JACK_TOKEN="u thought" npm start
```


## Goals

 - [X] Read Name
 - [X] Read msgs
 - [X] Deal with msgs
 - [ ] Implement response bodies
